## About me
I'm Tom Russo, and this is my website.  After working in tech for many years, I left the industry
in 2018 to become a doctor.  You can contact me by email at [{{ site.email }}][general-email], and
you can find me [here on GitHub][github-account].
<br>
<br>

## About the site
This site is generated using [Jekyll][jekyll-project] and hosted on [GitHub Pages][github-pages].
The look and feel is based on the [Minima theme][minima-theme], which I modified to remove the parts
I don't need.  Most content is rendered using [Markdown][markdown-description].
<br>
<br>

## Infrequently asked questions
**Can I use your site as a template to make my own?**
<br>
Yes you can.  The site is stored in a [GitHub repo][site-github-repo] and the template code is cleanly
separated from the content.  You are free to copy the template code, deploy it, and add your own content.

**Can I hire you for a project?**
<br>
Although I'm happy to entertain offers, I'm not actively looking for work, and I currently have very little
free time. That said, if you'd like to send a proposal, please send email to [tom@tomrusso.org][project-email].
