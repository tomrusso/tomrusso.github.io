## About me
![Tom Russo headshot](/assets/me.jpg#right-third)
I'm Tom Russo, and this is my website.  After working in tech for many years, I left the industry
in 2018 to become a doctor.  I'm currently a first year med student at [Wayne State University][wsu med],
which is located in [Detroit, Michigan, USA][wsu med map].  You can contact me by emailing
[{{ site.email }}][general email], you can find me [here on GitHub][github account], and you can
check out [my resum&eacute;][my resume].
<br>
<br>
I previously worked in the Windows Division at [Microsoft][microsoft] on the [Tablet PC][tablet pc].
More recently I worked for [August Home][august] developing internet-connected [door locks][august smart lock]
and [doorbell cameras][august doorbell cam].
<br>
<br>

## About the site
This site is generated using [Jekyll][jekyll project] and hosted on [GitHub Pages][github pages],
and DNS and caching are done through [Cloudflare][cloudflare].  The look and feel is based on the
[Minima theme][minima theme], with most content rendered using [Markdown][markdown description].
All source code is available in a publicly accessible [GitHub repo][site github repo].  Content
and presentation logic are cleanly separated in the hope that others will reuse the code, which you
should feel more than welcome to do.

## Projects & Consulting
I occasionally consult on outside projects, particularly those involving connected devices and the
Internet of Things.  Currently my free time is very limited, but if you'd like to send a proposal
please email [tom@tomrusso.org][project email].
