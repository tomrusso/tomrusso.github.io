I took this photo of my parents' backyard while I was at home during March 2020.  I was home
for a med school interview, and then got stuck there for about 7 weeks.  This post is a test
of what full width photos look like.

**Figure 1:** The idyllic backyard at my parents' estate during a snow squall in March 2020.
Visible to the right is the in-ground pool.  In the background is the fence that surrounds
the property.

And that should be that.  Let's have a look at what it actually looks like.  I really should
start writing content, but I'm still messing around with styles to try to get things to look
good.  Let's see how we did.
