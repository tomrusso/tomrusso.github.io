Two years ago, I left my job in the tech industry.  A lot has happened since then, and today
I'm happy to share that in two weeks I'll be starting medical school at
[Wayne State University][wsu med] in Detroit.  I spent almost 15 years in tech, and during
that time I worked with a variety of talented people and participated in some great projects.
It wasn't an easy decision to leave an established career and jump into the unknown.  But being
a doctor has been my dream since I was very young, and I realized that I either had to do it
now, or accept that it would never happen.

In the end I decided to go for it.  With the support of my family, friends, and colleagues, I've
spent the last two years taking premed courses, voluneering, and working as both an EMT and
a medical scribe.  Starting in June 2019, I applied to over 50 MD and DO programs.  Interviewing
at Wayne State left a fantastic impression, and I ultimately decided that this is the place
for me.  It's a strange feeling to be going back to school full-time after almost 20 years
away.  But I'm excited and looking forward to getting started.

I'm also happy to announce the (re)launch of my website, [tomrusso.org](/).  Among other things,
I'm planning to write about medicine, technology, and how they overlap.  I hope you'll come back
and give it a read :)
